# Kotlin Spring Boot PrimeSearch API

- /search/start -> Start the searching with a given thread count.
- /list         -> List the prime numbers in a given range.
- /search/stop  -> Stop the searching.

I created some unit tests. Feel free to run them.

Here is the [OpenAPI descriptor](https://github.com/Patrik-07/PrimeSearch/blob/master/openapi.json), for the easier testing.
